            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Since 1990, Fun4Less Vacations has earned a stellar reputation for managing North Myrtle Beach vacation rentals and oceanfront condos. These many years of experience have allowed us to find and maintain exceptional accommodations for our guests. Our inventory of rentals range from one to eight bedrooms and every price point. These condos and vacation homes are located within sub-sections of North Myrtle Beach, including Cherry Grove, Tilghman Beach, Ocean Drive, Crescent Beach, and Windy Hill. Fun4Less Vacations also offers golf villas and properties overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway available in the Little River area, plus beach condos rentals in the great Myrtle Beach area. As if that wasn’t enough, we also offer oceanfront condos as well as homes that are just a short walk from the shore. Be sure to browse our pet-friendly accommodations so that your home family can join you on vacation!

            <h2>Testimonial</h2>
            <p>We have been working for Fun4Less to rent our condo for more than 6 years.  The whole team is always helpful and responsive when we have any questions.  They keep a watchful eye on our property both when tenants are there and when it is vacant.  I feel like they are always concerned with protecting our investments.  We look forward to continuing to work with them for years to come.
